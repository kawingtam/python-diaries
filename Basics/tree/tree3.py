"""3. Count Total Nodes in a Tree
✅ Task: Write a function that counts how many nodes are in a binary tree.

Start with:

python
Copy
Edit
def count_nodes(root):
    # your code here
Try doing this without recursion first (using a queue or stack), then try it with recursion when you're ready.

4. Find the Height of a Tree
✅ Task: Write a function to find the height (maximum depth) of the tree.

Example:

A tree with just root → height = 1

A → B → D → height = 3

5. Check if a Node Exists
✅ Task: Given a value, write a function that checks if it exists in the tree.

Example:

python
Copy
Edit
def node_exists(root, target_value):
    # return True if value exists in tree
6. Print Leaf Nodes Only
✅ Task: Print only the nodes that don’t have children (leaf nodes).

From the earlier tree:

Leaf nodes: D, E, and C

7. Print All Values at a Specific Level
✅ Task: Write a function that prints all values at a given level k (e.g. level 2).

Level 1: A

Level 2: B, C

Level 3: D, E"""
